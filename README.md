Reminder / Tips:
- make sure to put a string "0" when it's less than 10 seconds (e.g. display as 01:05 rather than 01:5)
- two javascript files: countdown.js use vanilla js while script.js use jQuery
- If users enter invalid number (e.g. negative or greater than 60) for seconds, alert the users and make sure the timer display correctly
- countdown.js code copied from JS30 project by Wes Bos (check out his tutorial to learn more about how timer is made!)
- add a function to freeze / unfreeze the input once users start the timer
- understand the logic behind how start/stop/pause buttons work and make sure to disable stop/pause buttons when users haven't started the timer.

To do:
- incorporate two js files together
