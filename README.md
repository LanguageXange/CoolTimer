learning notes:
- make sure to put a string "0" when it's less than 10 seconds (e.g. display as 01:05 rather than 01:5)
- two javascript files: countdown.js use vanilla js while script.js use jQuery
- If users enter invalid number (e.g. negative or greater than 60) for seconds, alert the users and make sure the timer display correctly

Still editing this readme document...
